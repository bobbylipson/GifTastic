# GifTastic


GifTastic randomly searches and displays gifs of an animals. Once the ten random gifs are displayed, the user can click once for the gif to start and once more time to pause. There is an array of my favorite animals to choose from, or the user add an animal using the 'add your animal' button. Once the button is click, the animal will be added to the array and the new animal button will function like the others. Enjoy!
